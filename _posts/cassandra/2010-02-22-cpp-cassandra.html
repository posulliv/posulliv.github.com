title: Using the C++ Interface with Cassandra
---
Before starting, Cassandra needs to be downladed and installed. In a <a
href="http://posulliv.github.com/2009/09/07/building-a-small-cassandra-cluster-for-testing-and-development.html">previous post</a>, I
went through the steps involved in setting up a Cassandra cluster so I'm not going to repeat that
here. For this simple example though, I'll be using the following keyspace (which needs to be
present in the storage-conf.xml file):<br>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/311823.js"></script>
<br>

Once we have cassandra installed and running, we next need to download thrift from its <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/">Apache
homepage</a>. I went with the latest stable release which at the
time of writing is 0.2.0. Installation from the tarball is pretty straightforward but ensure to run
ldconfig after installing thrift.<br>

Once thrift is installed, we need to generate the C++ interface for Cassandra (this will be done as
the cassandra user if following the setup in my previous post):

<pre>
$ cd $CASSANDRA_HOME/interface
$ thrift --gen cpp cassandra.thrift
$ ls -ltr
total 44
drwxr-xr-x 3 cassandra cassandra  4096 2010-02-22 17:57 thrift
-rw-r--r-- 1 cassandra cassandra 21105 2010-02-22 17:57 cassandra.thrift
-rw-r--r-- 1 cassandra cassandra  3359 2010-02-22 17:57 cassandra.avpr
drwxr-xr-x 3 cassandra cassandra  4096 2010-02-22 18:01 avro
drwxr-xr-x 2 cassandra cassandra  4096 2010-02-22 21:41 gen-cpp
$ mkdir cpp-test
</pre>

Within the cpp-test directory, I'm going to create a file named simple-test.cc which looks like:<br>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/311827.js"></script>
<br>

To compile this, I used the following command line (assuming I am in the cpp-test directory):

<pre>
$ g++ -o cpptest -Wall -g \
> -I../gen-cpp/. \
> -I/usr/local/include/thrift \
> -L/usr/local/lib -lstdc++ -lthrift \
> simple-test.cc \
> ../gen-cpp/cassandra_constants.cpp \
> ../gen-cpp/cassandra_types.cpp \
> ../gen-cpp/Cassandra.cpp
$
</pre>

The above command will produce an executable named cpptest in the cpp-test directory. Assuming
cassandra is started, we run the binary and should obtain output like so:

<pre>
$ ./cpptest 
Column name retrieved is: second
Value in column retrieved is: this is data!!
$
</pre>

That's a simple example of using the C++ interface to Cassandra. Hopefully, this will prove useful
to someone but it took me longer than expected to get the above simple test working so I figured it
was worth writing up the steps I went through.
