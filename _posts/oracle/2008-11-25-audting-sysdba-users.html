title: Audting SYSDBA Users
category: oracle
---
I recently came accross this feature in Oracle introduced in 9i where all operations performed by a user connecting as SYSDBA are logged to an OS file. I'm sure most DBA's are familiar with this feature already but I have only just been enlightened!<br>

To enable this feature auditing must be enabled and the <code>AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS</code> parameter must be set to <code>TRUE</code>. For example:

<pre>
sys@ORCLINS1> ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS = TRUE SCOPE=SPFILE;
</pre>

FALSE is the default value for this parameter. Pretty obvious from the above statement but the database must be restarted for the parameter to take affect.<br>

All the audit records are then written to an operating system. The location of this file is determined by the <code>AUDIT_FILE_DEST</code> parameter.

<pre>
sys@ORCLINS1> show parameter AUDIT_FILE_DEST
NAME TYPE VALUE
>--------------  ------------------------------------------
audit_file_dest string /oracle/oracle/admin/orclpad/adump

sys@ORCLINS1>
</pre>

An audit file will be created for each session started by a user logging in as SYSDBA. The audit file will contain the process ID of the server session that Oracle started for the user in its file name.<br>

Most people are probably already familiar with this handy feature but I like to have it documented for myself somewhere so I put it here!
