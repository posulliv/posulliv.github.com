title: New Job at Akiban
---
Today marked the end of my first week of my new job at <a href="http://akibainc.com/">Akiban Technologies</a> in Boston.

I'm really excited about working here. Akiban is a small startup developing some really cool
technology that I believe will get people talking about the relational model in a good way again. We
are currently based in the South End of Boston and the building where we are located is pretty
awesome. Its not at all what I pictured an office to like. There is a resident artist in the
building who hangs his paintings on the walls and they seem to move to difference places at random
times. Its a strange feeling to walk in to work in the morning and smell fresh paint as I go to my
desk. Definitely not something I expected!

But besides all that, one of the best things for me about working here is that I get paid to
contribute to open source. I've been pretty involved with Drizzle for the last year while still a
student and it was always something I really enjoyed which I never thought someone would pay me to
work on. The community around the project is awesome and I was just happy to be involved with it.
Now that I get paid to contribute, it's nice to know that I can still be part of that community
without having to worry about how I'm going to make a living. It's weird to be paid for something
that I would still be doing anyway without the pay! I'm not complaining though, it's a nice change!

I'll be presenting at the MySQL conference in April, lots of awesome work is happening in the
Drizzle project, and Akiban will be out of stealth mode by the conference so there are some exciting
times ahead.
