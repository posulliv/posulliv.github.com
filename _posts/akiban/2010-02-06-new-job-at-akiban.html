title: New Job at Akiban
---
I just finished my first week at my new position as a software engineer at <a
href="http://akibainc.com>">Akiban Technologies</a> in Boston.
<br>

I'm really excited about working here. Akiban is a small startup developing some really cool
technology that I believe will get people talking about the relational model in a good way again. We
are currently based in the South End of Boston. The building where we are located is pretty awesome
and not at all what I pictured an office to be like. There is a resident artist in the building who
hangs his paintings on the walls and they seem to move to different places at random times. Its a
strange feeling to walk in to work in the morning and smell fresh paint as I go to my desk.
Definitely not something I expected!
<br>

But besides all that, one of the best things for me about working here is that I get paid to
contribute to open source. I've been pretty involved with Drizzle for the last year while
still a student and it was always something I really enjoyed which I never thought someone would pay
me to work on. The community around the project is awesome and I was just happy to be involved with
it. Now that I get paid to contribute, it's nice to know that I can still be part of that community
without having to worry about how I'm going to make a living. It's weird to be paid for something
that I would still be doing anyway without the pay! I'm not complaining though, it's a nice change!
<br>

I'll be presenting at the MySQL conference in April, lots of awesome work is happening in the
Drizzle project and Akiban will be out of stealth mode by the conference so there are some exciting
times ahead!
