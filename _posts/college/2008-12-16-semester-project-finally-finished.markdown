We just finished our semester project yesterday for the class I am taking on High Performance Computing. It was a pretty interesting project based on the topic of software fault injection.

More details can be found in the project report <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/%7Eposulliv/714_fault_injection_writeup_final.pdf">here</a>.
