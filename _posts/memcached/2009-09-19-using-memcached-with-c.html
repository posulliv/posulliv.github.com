title: Using Memcached with C++
---
For some plugins I am working on for <a href="http://www.drizzle.org/">Drizzle</a>, I am using the <a href="https://launchpad.net/libmemcached">libmemcached API</a>. However, the C++ interface for libmemcached was quite simple and not really C++ so we have updated it a little bit in the last few months since drizzle is written in C++ and it would be nice to use a more C++-like interface in libmemcached. In this post, I'll show some simple sample usage of the libmemcached C++ interface based on <a href="http://sacharya.com/using-memcached-with-java/">this article</a> about using memcached with Java. Please note that not all this functionality is in the latest stable version of libmemcached but it will likely be in the next release.

<h3>Installation</h3>
I am going to assume that memcached is already installed (see <a href="http://blog.ajohnstone.com/archives/installing-memcached/">here</a> for a good guide to installing it). To obtain libmemcached, we can either obtain the latest version of the source from launchpad, download an RPM, or download a tarball of the latest stable release and build that. I'm going to go with downloading a tarball since not everyone might have bzr installed. The latest stable release can be obtained from <a href="http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html">here</a>.

<pre>
$ cd libmemcached-0.32
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
</pre>

<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
The API is very similar to the C API except more suited to C++. Some simple examples of constructing a memcached client are shown:<br>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/189562.js"></script>
<br>

There are many more methods available than the 3 listed above but for most simple applications, those 3 should get you pretty far. We still need to add documentation for the C++ interface which should also be included in the next stable release of libmemcached.

<h3>MyCache Singleton</h3>
As done in the Java article, I create a wrapper around the memcached client as so:<br>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/189520.js"></script>
<br>

The DeletePtrs class is simply a generic function object that deletes the pointers in an STL container. I use this to delete all the Memcache objects in the vector before it is destroyed to ensure I don't have a memory leak (have a look at item 7 in Meyer's Effective STL for more information).

<h3>Sample Usage</h3>
Below, we show some samples of using the MyCache singleton. We assume that Product is some class that has been developed elsewhere that we want to cache.<br>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/189545.js"></script>
<br>

That's about it really. As you can see, the C++ interface has been improved in libmemcached. There is still some more work needed on the C++ interface but I think its starting to look a lot better.
