title: Simple Drizzle Replication Plugin for Cassandra
category: drizzle
---
This week, I'm giving a talk at <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a> in Portland on 
developing replication plugins for Drizzle. This talk will be based on the <a href="">tutorial</a> that
<a href="http://joinfu.com">Jay</a> and I gave at the MySQL User's Conference this year. What I want to
cover in this article is the process of creating a simple replication plugin that simply applies the 
replication events that occur in Drizzle to <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>.
<br>

Lots of the material in this article is directly due to input from Jay and in particular from
the <a href="http://joinfu.com/presentations/drizzle-replication-plugins/drizzle-replication-plugins.pdf/">presentation</a> 
Jay put together for our tutorial in April.
<br>

<h2>Drizzle Architecture & Replication Basics</h2>

As is pretty well known at this stage, Drizzle follows a micro-kernel design. Essentially, this means that
most features are built as plugins. For example, in Drizzle, authentication, logging, storage engines, etc.
are provided as plugins. The kernel is meant to be extremely small in size and provides the basic 
functionality a database server requires such as a parser, query optimizer, and query executor.
<br>

Replication in Drizzle is entirely row-based with the kernel being the marshall of all sources and targets of 
replicated data. The kernel constructs objects that represent changes made in the server. The objects 
constructed are of type <code>message::Transaction</code> and the kernel pushes these constructed objects
out to replication streams (a replication stream in Drizzle is a pairing of a replicator and an
applier).
<br>

The Transaction message in Drizzle is the basic unit of work in the replication system which represents a
set of changes that were made. We use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Google Protocol
Buffers</a> for representing these messages. The GPB definition for the Transaction message is contained
within the <code>drizzled/message/transaction.proto</code> file within the Drizzle source tree. Jay has
<a href="http://www.joinfu.com/2009/10/drizzle-replication-changes-in-api-to-support-group-commit/">
previously</a> gone into great detail on the GPB message definitions and I see no point in duplicating the
great articles Jay has written so I encourage you to read those if you are interested in knowing more about
the GPB message definitions.

<h2>Creating a Simple Cassandra Applier</h2>

Mainly, what I wanted to do in this article is to go through a simple example to demonstrate the replication
API. Please note that the plugin I'm going to cover for this example is extremely simple and probably
not very useful. Its main purpose is to serve as an example of how to develop a transaction applier plugin
that can apply transactions to a difference database system; in this case Cassandra.
<br>

Our Cassandra applier depends on 2 third-party libraries: 1) <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/thrift">
thrift</a> and 2)<a href="http://github.com/posulliv/libcassandra">libcassandra</a>. libcassandra is
a C++ wrapper for the thrift interface to Cassandra that I developed a few months ago to make it easier
for me to play with Cassandra when programming in C++. Its not very well tested but suits my purposes just
fine. 
<br>

Given that our plugin depends on some third-party libraries, my <code>plugin.ini</code> file will look like:

<br>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/420592.js"></script>
<br>

And my <code>plugin.ac</code> file will look like:

<br>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/420594.js"></script>
<br>

This takes care of my plugin's dependence on third-party libraries during the compilation process. If these
libraries are not present on the system when I compile Drizzle, then this plugin will not be compiled. 
<br>

As mentioned before, the plugin I am developing is a transaction applier. This means the plugin will be
implementing the <code>plugin::TransactionApplier</code> interface. The main function a plugin implementing
this interface needs to implement is the apply function:

The header file for the CassandraApplier class is defined in a new header file named <code>cassandra_applier.h</code>
which contains the class declaration that looks like:

<br>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/420596.js"></script>
<br>

The implementation is contained within the <code>cassandra_applier.cc</code> C++ file. The most interesting function in
this file is the plugin's implementation of the <code>apply()</code> function. In the case of the 
CassandraApplier, this function looks like:

<br>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/420597.js"></script>
<br>

One thing worth mentioned about the above function before delving into its details is that we assume
that there is 1 keyspace within Cassandra that we will replicating into. If this keyspace, is not present,
the function will fail. This is mainly because this allowed me to develop this plugin pretty quickly. There
is really no other reason for that. In reality, a more robust plugin would allow the keyspace to be 
configurable. Personally, I would prefer to have a way to specify the keyspace a statement should be 
replicated into specified in the SQL statement so it could be controlled on a per-statement basis. Not a 
major issue but I wanted to point this out in case anyone was wondering.
<br>

Now, the above function first looks at the Transaction message and determines how many Statement messages
are contained within it. Next, we loop through all the Statement messages contained within the Transaction
message. Depending on the type of the Statement message, we perform a different action. Right now, the 
plugin only cares about 3 types of Statements: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
<br>

However, the action performed for each action is virtualy identical. First the header for that type is
obtained. Next, the table metadata and actual data for the Statement is obtained. We then loop through
each field affected by this Statement. 
<br>

For example, with an INSERT Statement, we loop through each
field affected by the INSERT and obtain the field metadata for that field. We use this to obtain the key
that will be used for insertion in Cassandra. For this simple plugin, the key used by Cassandra is the
primary key of a table. The name of the field is used as a column name in Cassnadra and the value being
inserted for that field is used as the value for that column. The name of the table on which the INSERT
is happening corresponds to a column family name in Cassandra.
<br>

The initialization function for this plugin is pretty straightforward. We allocate memory for a 
CassandraApplier object and add that object the plugin registry:

All the above files I referenced are placed in a directory named cassandra_applier I created in the plugin
directory in the <code>lp:~posulliv/drizzle/rep-cassandra</code> branch on <a href="http://launchpad.net/drzzle">
Launchpad</a>. To download and compile the plugin, perform the following:

<pre>
bzr branch lp:~posulliv/drizzle/rep-cassandra
cd rep-cassandra
export CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/thrift
./config/autorun.sh
./configure --with-cassandra-applier-plugin
make
</pre>

If any of the third-part libraries required by the plugin are absent, you will see a message informing you
of that during the configure stage.
<br>

In order to start a Drizzle server from the above branch with the appropriate plugins loaded, I perform
the following:

<pre>
mkdir run
cd run
../drizzled/drizzled --basedir=$PWD \
--datadir=$PWD \
--plugin_add=default_replicator,cassandra_applier \
>> $PWD/drizzle.err 2>&1
</pre>

To make sure the correct replication stream is enbabled within Drizzle, I can query the data dictionary 
table Jay created for this purpose:

<pre>
drizzle> select * from data_dictionary.replication_streams;
+--------------------+-------------------+
| REPLICATOR         | APPLIER           |
+--------------------+-------------------+
| default_replicator | cassandra_applier | 
+--------------------+-------------------+
1 row in set (0 sec)

drizzle> 
</pre>

Next I'll start up my Cassandra cluster that the applier plugin will work with.

For reference, I'm using Cassandra 0.7 and the Cassandra cluster I used for this article is configured as follows (the 
<code>cassandra.yaml</code> file):

<br>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/420601.js"></script>
<br>

Now, to see the plugin in action, consider the following table in Drizzle:

<pre>
drizzle> create table padraig
    -> (
    ->   a int,
    ->   b varchar(128),
    ->   c varchar(128),
    ->   primary key(a)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

drizzle> 
</pre>

And assume we perform the following INSERT statements on the table:

<pre>
drizzle> insert into padraig (a, b) values (1, 'sarah');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.16 sec)

drizzle> insert into padraig (a, c) values (2, 'nimbus');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.15 sec)

drizzle> insert into padraig (a, b, c) values (3, 'domhnall', 'tomas');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.15 sec)

drizzle> 
</pre>

Now, to see what was inserted in Cassandra, we will use the Cassandra CLI interface:

<pre>
$ ./bin/cassandra-cli 
Welcome to cassandra CLI.

Type 'help' or '?' for help. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to quit.
[default@unknown] connect localhost/9160
Connected to: "Drizzle Example Cluster" on localhost/9160
[default@unknown] use drizzle;
Authenticated to keyspace: drizzle
[default@drizzle] get padraig['1']
=> (column=61, value=sarah, timestamp=1275376031524000)
Returned 1 results.
[default@drizzle] get padraig['2'] 
=> (column=62, value=nimbus, timestamp=1275376057537000)
Returned 1 results.
[default@drizzle] get padraig['3']                  
=> (column=62, value=domhnall, timestamp=1275376211981000)
=> (column=61, value=tomas, timestamp=1275376067097000)
Returned 2 results.
[default@drizzle] quit
$
</pre>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

That's about it for this article on Drizzle replication. If interested in more, feel free to ping the Drizzle
mailing list with questions or comments. Parts of replication are still under active development and I know
Jay loves to get feedback from people on the replication API in Drizzle.
