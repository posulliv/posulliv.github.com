title: Summer of Code Progress
---
Since we are around the half-way point in Google's Summer of Code, I thought I'd post a quick update on how things are going so far.<br>

Right now, INFORMATION_SCHEMA is nearly a full plugin in Drizzle. The final patch which finishes the extraction of I_S into a plugin has been proposed for merging and I'm still waiting for that to get pushed to trunk. Once that happens, I will be able to get started on modifying the implementation of the various I_S tables. All in all, its going pretty well. Its extremely satisfying to have patches accepted and placed straight into the codebase of the project that you are working on. I believe this is due to the fact that I am extremely lucky to be working on a project such as Drizzle with an awesome community. Unfortunately, I know that some SoC projects never get utilized which seems to me like a bit of a waste to me.<br>

To keep myself busy while waiting for patches to get merged, I decided to port the memcached UDF's to Drizzle. This has pretty much been completed save for a few UDF's that still need to be ported over. I added a test suite for the plugin tonight and am hoping to get it merged in the next week or two. A project that I'm just getting started with is creating a replication plugin for Drizzle that would send events to a memcached server. I'm hoping to get a simple prototype working in the next week or so and will then look for feedback from the community on it.<br>

I've been pretty busy this summer and so have not had much time for posting. I would like to say that will improve in the future but its unlikely!
