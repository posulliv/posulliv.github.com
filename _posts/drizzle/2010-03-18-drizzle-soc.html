title: Drizzle Accepted for GSoC 2010
category: drizzle
---
I just found out today that Drizzle was accepted as its own project for Google's Summer of Code this
year. Our organization is listed <a
href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/drizzle">here</a>.<br> 

I'm acting as the program administrator for Drizzle this year with <a href="http://oddments.org/">Eric Day</a> and I'm real excited about it. Last
year, I myself was a <a
href="http://posulliv.github.com/2009/04/21/google-summer-of-code.html">student in GSoC</a> working on drizzle and I feel like I got a lot out of
that program so I really wanted to see Drizzle accepted as its own project this year. Hopefully,
we can get lots of students working with us this year.<br>

As someone who participated as a student and is now acting as a mentor, I can say that it is
probably the best summer job any student could get. Basically, you get paid to work on an
open-source project with awesome people and work from home. It can't really get much better if you
ask me.<br>

And any students interested in working on Drizzle should check out our ideas page on the <a
