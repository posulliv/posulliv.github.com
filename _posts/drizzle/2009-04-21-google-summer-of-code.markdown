Yesterday, I found out that my proposal for Google's Summer of Code was <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/ccharles">accepted</a>. This means I'll be getting paid to work full-time on Drizzle during the summer! I'll write a longer post on my actual project soon and I'll be updating this blog much more regularly during the summer with updates on my project.

This week I'm at the <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009">MySQL user's conference</a> in Santa Clara where there are lots of interesting talks.
