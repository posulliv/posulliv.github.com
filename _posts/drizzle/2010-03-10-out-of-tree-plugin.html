title: Out of Tree Plugins in Drizzle
---
This week I've been working on porting the prototype MySQL storage engine developed at <a
href="http://akibainc.com">Akiban</a> to Drizzle. While doing this, I discovered that in Drizzle, it is
possible to build a plugin out of tree. When I say out of tree, I mean that I can develop a plugin
for drizzle and build it without having a copy of the drizzle source code. This is amazingly awesome
and is mostly due to the awesome build system that <a href="http://inaugust.com/">Monty</a> has put together.
This build system is called <a href="https://launchpad.net/pandora-build">Pandora Build</a> and if
you are ever working on a project that needs to use autoconf related tools, you should really check it out.
Its friggin awesome. It lets you concentrate on development instead of having to spend a bunch of
time trying to get a good build environment set up.<br>

Anyway, here I am going to go through an example of how to build a drizzle plugin out of tree. The
code is available at lp:~posulliv/drizzle/out-of-tree-example if anyone is interested in looking at
it. I am going to take an existing plugin in the drizzle source tree I developed and show how to
build it out of tree. The plugin I'm going to work with is the <a
href="http://posulliv.github.com/2009/09/29/viewing-memcached-statistics-from-drizzle.html">memcached_stats</a>
plugin.<br>

Before starting, its worth noting that Monty is working on creating a one-step tool for taking a
plugin that is currently in drizzle's source tree (that is, in the plugin directory of a drizzle
tree) and making it possible to build that plugin out of tree. His goal is that there need be no
changes in content between a directory that's in the drizzle source tree and one that's outside the
source tree.<br>

For this post, we will assume that we are working in a directory named mc-stats-plugin. Before
starting. this directory just contains source files. We will be adding all the build-related files
that are needed to build it.<br>

The first thing that is needed is a plugin.ini file for a plugin. For an out-of-tree plugin, a
name and url is required. Thus, the plugin.ini file for this plugin will look like:

<pre>
[plugin]
name=memcached_stats
title=Memcached Stats in DATA_DICTIONARY tables
description=Some DATA_DICTIONARY tables that provide Memcached stats
url=http://memcached.org/
version=0.1
disabled=yes
load_by_default=no
author=Padraig O Sullivan
license=PLUGIN_LICENSE_BSD
headers=stats_table.h analysis_table.h sysvar_holder.h
sources=memcached_stats.cc stats_table.cc analysis_table.cc
build_conditional="${ac_cv_libmemcached}" = "yes" -a "x${MEMCACHED_BINARY}" != "xno"
ldflags=${LTLIBMEMCACHED}
</pre>

Once that's done, we need to create a config directory and copy a few files from drizzle's trunk:

<pre>
$ cp $DRIZZLE_SRC_ROOT/config/config.rpath ./config/.
$ cp $DRIZZLE_SRC_ROOT/config/pandora-plugin ./config/.
$ cp -R $DRIZZLE_SRC_PORT/m4 .
</pre>

Like I said before, Monty is working on a tool that will automate the steps above. Now, we can
proceed and start compiling our plugin:

<pre>
$ ./config/pandora-plugin
$ autoreconf -i
libtoolize: putting auxiliary files in AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR, `config'.
libtoolize: copying file `config/config.guess'
libtoolize: copying file `config/config.sub'
libtoolize: copying file `config/install-sh'
libtoolize: copying file `config/ltmain.sh'
libtoolize: putting macros in `m4'.
libtoolize: copying file `m4/libtool.m4'
libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltoptions.m4'
libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltsugar.m4'
libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltversion.m4'
libtoolize: copying file `m4/lt~obsolete.m4'
libtoolize: Remember to add `LT_INIT' to configure.ac.
libtoolize: Consider adding `AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])' to configure.ac and
libtoolize: rerunning libtoolize, to keep the correct libtool macros in-tree.
configure.ac:7: installing `config/compile'
configure.ac:7: installing `config/missing'
Makefile.am: installing `config/depcomp'
$ ./configure
...
$ make
make  all-am
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/posulliv/repos/drizzle/mc-stats-plugin'
  CXX    libmemcached_stats_plugin_la-memcached_stats.lo
  CXX    libmemcached_stats_plugin_la-stats_table.lo
  CXX    libmemcached_stats_plugin_la-analysis_table.lo
  CXXLD  libmemcached_stats_plugin.la
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/posulliv/repos/drizzle/mc-stats-plugin'
$
</pre>

Now, our plugin is built. To install it, we simply do a make install. I just think this process
makes my life a whole lot easier and I wanted to bring some attention to how easy drizzle makes
developing plugins.
