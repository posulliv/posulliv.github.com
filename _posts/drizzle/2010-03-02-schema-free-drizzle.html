title: Schema-Free Drizzle!
---
I came across this <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2010/03/01/schema-free-mysql-vs-nosql/">post</a> from 
<a href="http://www.igvita.com">Ilya Grigorik</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> 
yesterday and I figured I just had to implement this in Drizzle now with the new query rewriting
interface that I mentioned <a href="http://posulliv.github.com/2010/03/01/query-rewrite.html">yesterday</a>.
The awesome thing about Drizzle is that I can try all these ideas out easily by just implementing a
plugin.
<br>

Any SQL statements we want to use on our schema-free constructs, we have to prefix with the string
'nos'. With that said, here is a session demonstrating this query rewriting plugin:

<pre>
Your Drizzle connection id is 2
Server version: 7 Source distribution (schema-less)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

drizzle> use test;
Database changed
drizzle> nos create table widgets;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

drizzle> nos insert into widgets (id,name) values ('a', 'apple');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.19 sec)

drizzle> nos insert into widgets (id,name,type) values ('b', 'blackberry', 'phone');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.21 sec)

drizzle> nos select * from widgets;
+------+------------+-------+
| id   | name       | type  |
+------+------------+-------+
| a    | apple      | NULL  | 
| b    | blackberry | phone | 
+------+------------+-------+
2 rows in set (0 sec)

drizzle> nos select * from widgets where id = 'a';
+------+-------+------+
| id   | name  | type |
+------+-------+------+
| a    | apple | NULL | 
+------+-------+------+
1 row in set (0 sec)

drizzle>
</pre>

The code for this is available on Launchpad (lp:~posulliv/drizzle/schema-less). I threw this
together in a few hours today for fun so it is what it is.
