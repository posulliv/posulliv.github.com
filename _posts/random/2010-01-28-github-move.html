title: Moved to GitHub Pages
---
I decided to move my blog to a new hosting provider - <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a>. The blogging software used with GitHub is <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a>.<br>

I really like the fact that everything is done via a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository. So far, I really like this setup.
