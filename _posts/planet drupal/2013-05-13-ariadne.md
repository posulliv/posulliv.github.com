title: Local Development with Ariadne

I recently started a new development position with [Blink Reaction][blink_link]
so I needed to get somewhat serious about setting up a local Drupal development
environment. 

## Ariadne

I was leaning towards making use of [Vagrant][vagrant_link] for managing local
development environments so I can easily switch between different projects or
branches. I also believe Vagrant makes it easier to have as close a mirror to
production locally as possible.

I discovered a very interesting project from [MyPlanet Digital][myplanet_link]
named [vagrant-ariadne][ariadne_link]. Ariadne is a customized implementation of
Vagrant and allows for easy deployment of Drupal installation profiles to a local
VM. Another nice feature is that it attempts to emulate Acquia's infrastructure.
This is useful as a lot of Blink's clients are deployed on the Acquia Cloud.

Assuming you have Vagrant, rvm and a ruby environment installed on your workstation,
installing Ariadne is pretty straightforward:

{% highlight console %}j
vagrant gem install vagrant-vbguest vagrant-hostmaster vagrant-librarian
[sudo] gem install librarian rake knife-solo
git clone https://github.com/myplanetdigital/vagrant-ariadne.git
cd vagrant-ariadne
bundle install
bundle exec rake setup
{% endhighlight %}

Everything is now configured to boot a virtual box. Ariadne comes with a simple
example that can be deployed:

{% highlight console %}j
project=example vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}

Once that command finishes running, the site can be viewed at `http://example.dev/`
(Ariadne uses [vagrant-hostmaster][hostmaster_link] for managing `/etc/hosts` entries).

A more involved cookbook is a cookbook for deploying the [Web Experience Toolkit][wet_link]
available on [github also][wet_cookbook]. If we wanted to deploy the master branch
of this site, we could do:

```
bundle exec rake "init_project[https://github.com/wet-boew/ariadne-wet-boew-drupal]"
project=wet-boew-drupal branch=master vagrant up
```

And that's it!

Another nice feature of these deployed environments is that they are configured to allow
remote debugging (relevant when setting up an IDE as mentioned later) and the actual
site code is shared as an NFS mount. For example, the contents of my `/etc/exports`
file after booting a box with Ariadne looks like:

{% highlight console %}
# VAGRANT-BEGIN: 7ac1cf50-4498-4e49-bd66-edac4a9b2d7e
"/Users/posullivan/vagrant-ariadne/tmp/apt/cache" 33.33.33.10 -mapall=501:20
"/Users/posullivan/vagrant-ariadne/tmp/drush/cache" 33.33.33.10 -mapall=501:20
"/Users/posullivan/vagrant-ariadne/data/html" 33.33.33.10 -mapall=501:20
# VAGRANT-END: 7ac1cf50-4498-4e49-bd66-edac4a9b2d7e
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, if I navigate to the `~/vagrant-ariadne/data/html` directory or import that in my
IDE, I can edit the code deployed on the vagrant box.

### Drupal Core from git

Another use I've found for ariadne is building a local environment for the latest drupal
core. To accomplish this, I created a role file named `roles/core.rb` with the following
contents:

{% highlight ruby %}
name "core"
description "Install requirements to run Drupal core."
run_list([
  "recipe[mysql::server]",
  "recipe[mysql::client]",
  "recipe[php::module_mysql]",
  "recipe[php::module_curl]",
  "recipe[php::module_gd]",
  "recipe[php::module_apc]",
  "recipe[drush::utils]",
  "recipe[drush::make]",
  "recipe[php::write_inis]",
])
default_attributes({
  :drush => {
    :version => "5.8.0",
  },
  :mysql => {
    :server_debian_password => "root",
    :server_root_password => "root",
    :server_repl_password => "root",
    :bind_address => "127.0.0.1",
    :tunable => {
      :key_buffer => "384M",
      :table_cache => "4096",
    },
  },
})
{% endhighlight %}j

Next, I created a new cookbook project named `core` and created a simple `default.rb`
recipe for this cookbook. This recipe looks like:

{% highlight ruby %}
branch = node['ariadne']['branch']

git "/mnt/www/html/drupal" do
  user "vagrant"
  repository "http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git"
  reference branch
  enable_submodules true
  action :sync
  notifies :run, "bash[Installing Drupal...]", :immediately
end

bash "Installing Drupal..." do
  user "vagrant"
  group "vagrant"
  code <<-EOH
    drush -y si \
      --root=/mnt/www/html/drupal \
      --db-url=mysqli://root:root@localhost/drupal \
      --site-name="Drupal Core Installed from Git" \
      --site-mail=vagrant+site@localhost \
      --account-mail=vagrant+admin@locahost \
      --account-name=admin \
      --account-pass=admin
  EOH
end

site = node['ariadne']['host_name'].nil? ? "#{node['ariadne']['project']}.dev" : node['ariadne']['host_name']

web_app site do
  cookbook "ariadne"
  template "drupal-site.conf.erb"
  port node['apache']['listen_ports'].to_a[0]
  server_name site
  server_aliases [ "www.#{site}" ]
  docroot "/mnt/www/html/drupal"
  notifies :reload, "service[apache2]"
end
{% endhighlight %}

With all of the above in place, its quite simple to create a local VM based on the
latest in the `7.x` branch of drupal core:

{% highlight bash %}
project=core branch=7.x vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}

The above command simply needs to have the branch name modified to deploy a
different branch. Once the above command completes, a site will be available
at `core.dev` and I can log in as the `admin` user using the credentials
specified in my cookbook.

### Private Repositories

Most repositories for client projects are stored in private repositories.
Thankfully, thats not an issue with ariadne. Ariadne uses agent forwarding to
forward the host machine's ssh session into the VM, including keys and
passphrases stored by ssh-agent. What this means is that your VM will have the
same Git/SSH access that you enjoy on your local machine. I've not had a
problem checking out code stored in private repositories on bitbucket for example.

## IDE

For an IDE, I've been an Eclipse user in the past for Java projects I've worked
on so [Aptana][aptana_link] seemed like a good fit for my needs at the moment. A
few [existing][first_aptana_article] [articles][second_aptana_article] already
exist on configuring Aptana for Drupal development so I'm not going to go into
too much details here. 

Installation is very straightforward with the binary downloaded from the
[site][aptana_link]. A ruble exists for Drupal so its pretty natural to install
that:

{% highlight console %}
git clone git://github.com/arcaneadam/Drupal-Bundle-for-Aptana.git ~/Documents/Aptana Rubles/Drupal-Bundle-for-Aptana
{% endhighlight %}

Next item is to configure Aptana to adhere to the Drupal coding standards. I
used an [existing profile for Aptana][aptana_drupal_coding_stds] that could be
imported for this.

The final thing I needed to configure was a debug configuration. To do this, I
created a new PHP web page configuration. First, a new PHP server needs to be
added. In this example, lets assume I am using the example box I mentioned in
the Ariadne section whose hostname is `example.dev`. The web server
configuration dialog when configured with this hostname and appropriate
directory for the site root looks like:

![image](/images/aptana_first.png)

Once a PHP server has been added, the rest of the information to fill in for
the debug configuration is pretty straightforward as shown below:

![image](/images/aptana_second.png)

I like to select the break at first line option to make sure the debug
configuration works correctly. 

With this in place, any visit to `example.dev` will result in the
breakpoint being hit.

## Conclusion

I've still not settled on this combination for my development environment
but I was definitely pretty excited upon discovering the Ariadne project.
The drawbacks that I see to using Ariadne are: 1) the need to create a
cookbook for each project you want to work with, 2) the project is still in
beta stage so documentation is fairly lacking (fair enough for a beta project
though), and 3) if you are not familiar with [chef][chef_link], using Ariadne
may prove challenging (although it provides the perfect excuse to become
familiar with chef).

PHPStorm is the IDE that seems to be pretty popular when I ask what other
people are using for an editor but given there is a license fee associated
with it, I didn't want to splurge on that just yet. Aptana looks to work just
fine for me and satisfies my needs nicely.
