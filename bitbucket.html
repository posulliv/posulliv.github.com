    <h1>I Am An Idiot</h1>

    <p>
      This page used to contain a comparison of the content of GitHub and 
      BitBucket.  It was something I did personally, not on behalf of GitHub.
    </p>
          
    <p>
      This content has been taken too seriously.  
      I did not mean for it to get the sort of attention it has, I should 
      probably not have put it together in the first place.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Everyone is right - it is pedantic and beneath me, and I apologize. 
      I simply was curious what it would look like when you put all the 
      images together, I ranted a bit and then I wrongly put it on my user page.  
      I never posted a link to it anywhere or tried to get people to read it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Again, I am sorry for being a tool. I promise to try to do so less often
      in the future.
    </p>
